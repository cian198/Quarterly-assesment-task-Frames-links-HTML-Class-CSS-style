     <h2 class="Hazardmain">&#9763 Biohazards &#9763</h2>
    <p class="Hazardp">A biological substance that endangers the health of living things, especially humans, is referred to as a biological hazard or biohazard. A sample of a fungus, virus, or toxin that can be harmful to human health may be included in this. A substance poisonous to other creatures might also be considered a biohazard.</p>

    <h2 class="Hazard">Viruses</h2>
    <img src="Virus.jpg" alt="Infection" class="Hazardimg">
    <p class="Hazardp">Microbes (viruses, bacteria), which are included in biohazards, can range in four biohazard levels, from level 1 with little precaution to level 4 with microbes that are fatal and have no treatment when caught. Common microbes like E. coli and chickenpox are found in BSL 1, while viruses like Ebola, the Marburg virus, Lassa fever, and numerous hemorrhagic viruses found in the tropics are found in BSL 4.</p>

    <h2 class="Hazard">Fungi</h2>
    <img src="C. Auris.jpeg" alt="Canida_Auris" class="Hazardimg">
    <p class="Hazardp">Another prevalent biohazard is fungi, which isn't as dangerous as viruses because most of them are actually harmless, however some of them can be hazardous to health. There are two types of fungal infections: primary and opportunistic. Systemic infections are ones that spread throughout the body, while localized infections are those that only affect one location. Biohazard level 2 (BSL 2) contains fungi.</p>

	<h2 class="Hazard">Toxins</h2>
    <img src="TTX.jpg" alt="Tetrodotoxin" class="Hazardimg">
    <p class="Hazardp">Poisonous substances known as biological toxins are created by specific animals, plants, and microorganisms. These toxins can easily kill a person with a very miniscule amount, but they are not as deadly as viruses because viruses can spread and infect others, whereas toxins must be injected or ingested to work. Examples of toxins of biological origin include Diphtheria Toxin, Tetrodotoxin, Pertussis Toxin, Botulinium Toxin, Snake Venom Toxins, Conotoxin and Ricin.<p>
