<h1 class="AutoBio">My Auto Biography</h1>

<p class="AutoBioP">My name is Christian C. Rebosa, I was born in Metro Manila, Philippines, on November 12, 2007. My parents are Wilfredo Rebosa and Rosielyn Calica, and the only sibling I have is Christine Rebosa, a grade 11 student at UBSHS. Last year, I was given the highest honor and was given a Cem academic achievement award in science.  Attending a science school helped me to grow academically with diligence, and as a person, giving me high moral standards.</p>

<p class="AutoBioP">As a student I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up.  Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. I love arts and computer related topics.  My weaknesses are that sometimes I take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others.</p>
    
<p class="AutoBioP">As the son of a single mother, my life's goal is to help and be a pillar of strength for my mom and our family. Being able to be trusted to be genuine to myself, express what I mean and feel, and act with integrity.  The most important thing to be a good son is that being good and loving my family should not be considered as a duty.  Being a good son is a way of life, not something I am obligated to do.</p>
    
<p class="AutoBioP">My career goal is to become a computer engineer since it allows me to better comprehend the theory underlying the procedures involved in developing computer programs and applications. As technology advances, our environment is becoming increasingly digital, and computers are becoming more and more competent.  My goal is not just to land in a good job but also to make our lives easy with every day innovation.  With being a computer engineer it can help me widen my creative horizon and provide solutions to the problems people through computer technology.</p>
