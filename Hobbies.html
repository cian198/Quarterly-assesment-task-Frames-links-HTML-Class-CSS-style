<h2 class="Hazard">1. Cubing</h2>
<p>I recently started cubing in this year(about late August), when we were cleaning our old "toy room" that's where I saw a Rubik's cube unsolved and all scrambled up. I tried to solve the cube after cleaning the room out of regret because I was probably the one who had jumbled it and had left it unanswered throughout the years. After a while, I became addicted to solving the cube and became faster in the process. It eventually became my main interest after months of speed improvement. I began this journey for speedÂ because I was intrigued by how a seemingly basic 3x3 cube could be so complex and have such a sophisticated solution, and that this seemingly impossible puzzle could be solved with the right information and practice in under a minute.</p>

<h2 class="Hazard">2. Origami</h2>
<p>In Grade 2, I was exposed to the art of origami by a friend who had a book on it and wanted to show me and my friends how to fold a crane and a paper shuriken. We eventually worked out what the diagrams and terminology meant and had constructed our first paper crane. By the time we finished the book, which had about 124 pages, we had known how to create multiple items like furniture, boats, animas, 3d shapes, and even a shape -shifting circle. The fact that a flat, uninteresting square of paper could be transformed into such a complicated creation and that the procedure was somewhat difficult but straightforward definitely piqued our curiosity. </p>
